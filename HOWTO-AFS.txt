HOWTO-AFS (updated 13rd November 2024)
----------------------------------------
----------------------------------------

Important Note!

The access via AFS is not OBSOLETE. ZECM has shutdown it.
So all instructions below are NOT WORKING anymore.

We leave it here just for archiving purposes.

**********************************************


Requirements 
-------------
- ZECM account (tubIT)
- pelican (a python package) - installation installation instructions below
- AFS client                 - installation installation instructions below 



------------------------------------
Installation - to be done only once
------------------------------------


0. Install AFS

a) First, it is necessary to have the kernel headers installed 
   (this is not clear in the TU website, so I add the instructions here)

   You can install them by executing

   >> sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)


b) Install the AFS client. Follow the instructions in:

https://www.campusmanagement.tu-berlin.de/menue/dienste/daten_server/andrew_file_system/zugriff_auf_afs_daten_per_openafs_client/afs_client_installation_ubuntu/

(Schritte 1 bis 5)

Schritt 5 nach der Installation
kinit Benutzername
aklog 


c) After configuring, you should have access to the folder /afs/tu-berlin.de/units/Fak_IV/psyco/www/www.psyco/htdocs

You can test the access by running on a terminal

    >> cd /afs/tu-berlin.de/units/Fak_IV/psyco/www/www.psyco/htdocs
    >> ls


You should see a list of files. 



1. Install Pelican with your package manager. In Debian / Ubuntu, use

   >> sudo apt-get install pelican

   alternatively you can use pip

   >> pip install pelican


2. Clone the repository to a local folder

   >> git clone --recursive  git@github.com:computational-psychology/computational-psychology-www.git
 
   If you haven't used github before, you need to:
     - be added to our organization 'computational-psychology' -> ask Guillermo to add you
     - add your public key (id_rsa.pub located in your .ssh folder) to your github account




----------------------------------
Workflow - how to update the site
----------------------------------


To edit locally:
----------------
1. Go to the repository root folder and pull the latest version from 
   github with 

   >> git pull

2. Edit what you need to edit.
   Pages are located in content/pages, images in content/imgs


3. After editing, go to root of your local repository and run 

  >> make html

to test that the website renders locally. No errors should occur.

You can see the local version of the page inside folder  output/

You can open the file output/index.html with a browser to have a quick
look at the page and your changes. It can be that the font formatting 
is not right, don't worry. Once in the server it will look OK.

   
To save changes:
------------------
4. Save your changes with 
   >> git add newfiles... 
   >> git commit -m "your commit message".

   Push your changes to github with 

   >> git push'



To publish your changes:
-------------------------

5. First you need to make sure that you have AFS running and be logged in:
	
   - by default AFS shoud be running as a service. You can check that with 

     >> sudo service openafs-client  status

     The terminal returns the status of the service, saying "Active: active (running").
 
	
   - Log-in with you TU credentials. This is needed only once after restart. 
     Run the following two commands, replacing 'username' with your own TU login name.  
     You will also have to enter your TU password 

	
     >> kinit username'
     >> aklog'

     If no error or output is returned, then you're sucessfully logged-in. 

     If things do not work - check whether you have access to AFS folder
     
     >> cd /afs/tu-berlin.de/units/Fak_IV/psyco/www/www.psyco/htdocs
     >> ls


6. Finally, publish you changes by copying edited files to our AFS directory. 
   Go to root of local repository and run 

      >> ./publish_afs.sh



Check your changes in the live website
--------------------------------------

Your changes should be visible on the website now. Remember to

7. Reload the page in your browser.
