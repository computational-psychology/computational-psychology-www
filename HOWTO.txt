Requirements

pelican and having AFS configured in your machine (requirement: tubIT account)



Installation
------------

0. Follow instructions from tubIT on how to install access to AFS
    After configuring, you should have access to the folder
    /afs/tu-berlin.de/units/Fak_IV/psyco/www/www.psyco/htdocs
    
1. Install Pelican apt-get or using pip.
	'sudo apt-get install pelican'
	
	alternatively, 'pip install pelican' 
		
2. Clone the repository to a local folder

	'git clone --recursive  git@github.com:computational-psychology/computational-psychology.github.io.git'




Workflow
----------

1. Go to the repository root folder and pull the latest version from github with 'git pull'

2. Edit what you need to edit.
	Pages are located in content/pages, images in content/imgs
	
3. After editing, run 'make html' to test that the website compiles locally. No errors should occur.

4. Save your changes with 'git add' and 'git commit'.  Push your changes to github with 'git push'

5. To publish, first you need to have AFS running and be logged in:
	- 
	- 


6. Finally, publish you changes by running the shell script ./publish.sh.

	This will deploy the changes by coping the output/ folder which contains the rendered website
	to the website folder in the server mounted via AFS.
