---------------------------------
---------------------------------

Instructions on how to edit the website.


Requirements 
-------------
- ZECM account (tubIT)
- pelican (a python package) - installation installation instructions below
- an SSH client              - installation installation instructions below 


------------------------------------
Installation - to be done only once
------------------------------------

0. Install and check that your SSH connection works

SSH allows you to connect via command line to a remote linux machine. 
We need it here because we need to copy the website's content
via SSH to the server. 

a) install the client if you don't have it yet

in Debian and Ubuntu, you run 

  >> sudo apt install ssh

b) test that you can access the TU server. Run the following command

  >> ssh username@sshgate.tu-berlin.de

replace username with your TU login username. It will ask for your TU 
password, and then an OTP (two-factor authentification, which you should
configure to use TOTP, not SMS). You'll see a welcome message.

c) once logged in, check that you have access to the following folder by 
changing directory to it and listing its content

   >> cd /afs/tu-berlin.de/units/Fak_IV/psyco/www/www.psyco/htdocs
   >> ls -l

should show the list of files in our website.

Before you continue with this howto, exit the connection to the TU
server with the command

   >> exit

    
1. Install Pelican with your package manager. In Debian / Ubuntu, use

   >> sudo apt-get install pelican

   alternatively you can use pip

   >> pip install pelican


2. Clone the repository to a local folder

   >> git clone --recursive  git@github.com:computational-psychology/computational-psychology-www.git
 
   If you haven't used github before, you need to:
     - be added to our organization 'computational-psychology' -> ask Guillermo to add you
     - add your public key (id_rsa.pub located in your .ssh folder) to your github account

Workflow - how to update the site
----------------------------------


To edit locally:
----------------
1. Go to the repository root folder and pull the latest version from 
   github with 

   >> git pull

2. Edit what you need to edit.
   Pages are located in content/pages, images in content/imgs


3. After editing, go to root of your local repository and run 

  >> make html

to test that the website renders locally. No errors should occur.

You can see the local version of the page inside folder  output/

You can open the file output/index.html with a browser to have a quick
look at the page and your changes. It can be that the font formatting 
is not right, don't worry. Once in the server it will look OK.

   
To save changes:
------------------
4. Save your changes with 
   >> git add newfiles... 
   >> git commit -m "your commit message".

   Push your changes to github with 

   >> git push



To publish your changes:
-------------------------
5. Run the script 

  >> ./publish.sh username

Replace 'username' with your TU login username (without @tu-berlin.de).

You need to enter your TU password and the OTP for two-factor authentification.

The script will copy the new files to the server.
