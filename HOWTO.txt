HOWTO (updated 20th January 2021)
---------------------------------
---------------------------------

Requirements 
-------------
- ZECM account (tubIT)
- pelican (a python package)
- an SSH client


------------
Installation
------------

0. Install and check that your SSH connection works

SSH allows you to connect via command line to a remote linux machine. 
We need it here because we need to copy the website's content
via SSH to the server. 

a) install the client if you don't have it yet

in Debian and Ubuntu, you run  'sudo apt install ssh' 

b) test that you can access the TU server. Run the following command

'ssh username@sshgate.tu-berlin.de'

replace username with your TU login username. It will ask for your TU 
password. You'll see a welcome message.

c) once logged in, check that you have access to the following folder by 
changing directory to it and listing its content

'cd /afs/tu-berlin.de/units/Fak_IV/psyco/www/www.psyco/htdocs'
'ls -l'

should show the list of files in our website.

Before you continue with this howto, exit the connection to the TU
server with the command

'exit'


    
1. Install Pelican apt-get or using pip.
   'sudo apt-get install pelican'

   alternatively, 'pip install pelican' 


2. Clone the repository to a local folder

   'git clone --recursive  git@github.com:computational-psychology/computational-psychology-www.git'
    

    if you haven't used github before, you need to:
        - be added to our organization 'computational-psychology' -> ask Guillermo to add you
        - add your public key (id_rsa.pub located in your .ssh folder) to your github account



---------
Workflow
---------


To edit locally:
----------------
1. Go to the repository root folder and pull the latest version from 
   github with 'git pull'

2. Edit what you need to edit.
   Pages are located in content/pages, images in content/imgs


3. After editing, go to root of your local repository and run 

'make html'

to test that the website renders locally. No errors should occur.

You can see the local version of the page inside folder  output/

You can open the file output/index.html with a browser to have a quick
look at the page and your changes. It can be that the font formatting 
is not right, don't worry. Once in the server it will look OK.

   
To save changes:
------------------
4. Save your changes with 'git add' and 'git commit'.  

Push your changes to github with 'git push'



To publish your changes:
-------------------------
5. Run the script 

./publish.sh username

Replace 'username' with your TU login username. The script will copy 
the new files to the server. 

Your changes should be visible on the website now. Remember to

- Reload the page in your browser.
