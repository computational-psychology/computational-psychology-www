We are interested in the question how the perceptual system generates meaningful perceptual
categories from a given sensory stimulation. The figure below shows a powerful demonstration of the
functioning principles of the human visual system. Most literate observers readily perceive the line fragments as part of capital letter 'E'. The goal of our research is to understand the functioning principles which allow human perception to work as it does.

Experimental characterization of lightness constancy
-----------------------------------------------------

The perceptual domain in which we currently study the above question is lightness. Human observers  perceive the lightness of surfaces relatively stable despite tremendous fluctuation in the sensory signal due to changes in viewing conditions. The luminance that is reflected to the eye from one and the same surface might vary substantially depending on whether the surface is seen under direct illumination or might be obscured by a shadow.


Evaluation of experimental techniques to measure appearance
------------------------------------------------------------


An early vision model of lightness perception
-----------------------------------------------

Our goal is to develop a mechanistic account of the computational principles and mechanisms that transform retinal sensations into meaningful percepts. We address this goal in the domain of lightness perception and want to understand how surface lightness is determined from the luminance signal in the retina. A computational model of lightness should receive a 2d matrix of gray values as input and compute the perceived lightness at all image positions as output.

Increments and decrements in naturalistic stimuli
--------------------------------------------------

In this project we study the question under which conditions increments and decrements are matched with targets of opposite polarity.



Depth perception in 3d scenes
-------------------------------

The perception of surface lightness is influenced by the depth arrangement of a scene. To study depth perception under naturalistic conditions we collaborate with the Computer Graphics lab. We use objects that are created by means of 3d printing on the basis of mesh models. The availability of these models
means that for each 3d object a corresponding image of the object can be rendered on the computer. We test perceptual responses to 3d objects and their 2d counterparts.



Manual dexterity in humans and robots
---------------------------------------

Human grasping skills are far superior to those of robots. In collaboration with the Robotics lab we investigate the principles that lead to this superior performance in human grasping and work towards transferring these principles to robotic systems. Our key hypothesis is that human  grasping performance crucially depens on the purposeful exploitation of contact with the environment.
