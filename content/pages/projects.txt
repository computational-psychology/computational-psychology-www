1. Image segmentation (Computer vision student)
	Histogram comparison of contrast ranges with RMSM using dead leaves

2. Measuring perceptual scales for perceived contrast.
	various stimuli: repeat previous results for simple stimuli (maybe gratings)
			Sullivan and Georgeson 1975
			E. Peli 
		plus variegated checkerboards

	Guillermo: write proposal for DFG (?) 

3. Follow up on Chubb 1989's contrast-contrast phenomenon and our variegated checkerboards.
	VSS19 poster on p. transparency shows phenomenon that p. contrast with v.c. surround looks
	more contrasty than cut-out stimuli -> opposite effect than in contrast-contrast.

4. Perceived transaprency / perceived contrast with episcotisters  (electrical engenieering student)
	building with real stimuli, cardboard and motors to build rack


5. Crispening in real world stimuli (Carolin)
	with real checkerboards: cardboard print outs
	check location is always the same, also in a 3x3 array
	spacing closer together than in our prev. paper
	measure one scale with thurstonian scaling  / matching task with munsell patches next to it 
	an episcotister / transparency can be added to reduce the contrast, becuase it could be that 
		print outs are not accurarate
