We believe in reproducible science. We strive to make the (software) 
tools that we develop in our research publicly available. 
Below you can find a list of our main projects, `all available in Github. <https://github.com/computational-psychology/>`_
You are welcome to contribute via the same platform, by opening a 
pull request or raising an issue. If you find a bug, please let us know! 
(either via github or `e-mail <https://www.psyco.tu-berlin.de/people.html>`_.).


In the `Publications page <https://www.psyco.tu-berlin.de/publications.html>`_ you also find 
code and data related to specific publications (those are not listed here below).
