We believe in reproducible science. We strive to make publicly available the (software)
tools that we have developed during our research.
Below you can find a list of our main projects, `all available in Github. <https://github.com/computational-psychology/>`_
You can also find code and data related to publications.
You are welcome to contribute via the same platform, by opening a pull request 
or raising an issue. If you find a bug, please let us know!
