We offer **Bachelor's and Master's theses** in the area of **visual perception research**. 
If you are interested in inquiring, please first read the section General Information below.



General Thesis Information 
###########################

Please read the following content carefully before inquiring about a topic.


Who can write a thesis with us and what are the prerequisites?
******************************************************************

In general, any student with interest in visual perception and some programming skills is welcome to write a Bachelor’s or Master’s thesis in our group. However, we do require that you have attended a `Seminar taught by our department <teaching.html>`_.

To ensure the successful completion of a thesis, we see the following requirements:

- completion of a `Seminar taught by our deparment <teaching.html>`_, in which we introduce basic aspects of visual perception and how to develop a research project.  
- interest in visual perception research
- programming skills in python or R
- good English skills to read the relevant literature
- scientific curiosity
- ability to work independently



How do you get a topic?
************************

You can find some topics here in our website (`project descriptions <projects.html>`_) but that list is not exhaustive. 
Since not all ideas make their way here, feel invited to also make yourself familiar with our current research areas (e.g. take a look at the current projects and recent publications) and then contact the respective researchers directly.



What is the general process of writing a thesis?
****************************************************

We have elaborated a workflow which illustrates roughly the steps during a thesis, see below.

Once you have met with one of our researchers and have found a topic that is interesting to you, we ask you to write an exposé  which motivates the research question, revises the relevant literature, proposes how to address the problem / research question and also provides a rough timeline for your thesis. We have written some `Exposé guidelines <files/theses/BA_expose.pdf>`_ to help you with it.
 
During the thesis project, the supervising researcher will be available to provide guidance and feedback. 
To support the process we ask supervisor and student to fill out the survey `"Establishing a good relationship from the Beginning" <files/theses/establishing-a-good-relationship-from-the-beginning-2017.pdf>`_, and discuss it together. This survey was developed by `Anne Lee <http://www.drannelee.wordpress.com/>`_ and provides a tool to evaluate *expectations* during supervision. The  ultimate goal of using this tool is to have a fulfilling supervision experience for both parties, supervisor and student.

Please also take a look at the Study and Examination Regulations (StuPo) of your program, which contain further information about duration, language, and other conditions for the successful completion of a thesis.
