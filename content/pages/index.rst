      We study visual perception in humans, both experimentally and through computational modeling. We focus on the question how meaningful perceptual categories arise from a given sensory stimulation. In vision the sensory stimulation is the information available in the light signal incident at the eye. We tackle this problem with psychophysical experiments and measure for example how surface appearance is related to physical surface properties under varying viewing conditions. We formulate computational models to account for the perceptual judgments observers make. In addition, we revise and develop experimental techniques that we can use to reliably assess observers' perceptions.
