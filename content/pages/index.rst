      We study visual perception in humans, both experimentally and 
      through computational modeling. We focus on the question how
      meaningful perceptual categories arise from a given sensory 
      stimulation. In vision the sensory stimulation is the information 
      available in the light signal incident at the eye. 
      We tackle this problem with psychophysical experiments 
      and measure for example how surface appearance is related to 
      physical surface properties under varying viewing conditions. 
      We formulate computational models to account for the 
      perceptual judgments observers make. 
      In addition, we revise and develop experimental techniques 
      that we can use to reliably assess observers' perceptions.

Lynn Schmittwilken has been awarded a 2021 FoVea Travel and Networking Award! 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On 18 March 2021, Scholar Minds will talk about "Becoming aware through mindfulness" during the Brain Awareness Week 2021.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On Thursday, 18th of March, at 5pm Scholar Minds invites you to an online event about mindfulness and mental helath during the doctorate. Scholar Minds is a PhD initiative based in Berlin with the mission to help other PhD students to achieve a better mental health and work-life balance.
Pursuing a doctorate is an exceptional time with great opportunities like investigating a phenomenon no one ever did before or discussing your research with new people from all over the world. But are you aware that this exceptional time also harbors exceptional dangers to your mental health? Are you aware that you as a PhD student are six times more likely to suffer from anxiety and depression? During the event, we will talk about mental health struggles related to the doctorate and introduce you to a tool to become more resilient: mindfulness. Mindfulness is a simple meditation tool that can help you to increase your mental well-being.

During the event, the mindfulness expert Dr. Simon Guendelman will present the concept of mindfulness and latest findings from (neuroscientific) research. On top, he will take us onto a little journey to become more aware about ourselves through mindfulness.

Establishing a representation of space is a major goal of sensory systems. Spatial information, however, is not always explicit in the incoming sensory signals. In most modalities it needs to be actively extracted from cues embedded in the temporal flow of receptor activation. Vision, on the other hand, starts with a sophisticated optical imaging system that explicitly preserves spatial information on the retina. This may lead to the assumption that vision is predominantly a passive spatial process: all that is needed is to transmit the retinal image to the cortex, like uploading a digital photograph, to establish a spatial map of the world. However, this deceptively simple analogy is inconsistent with theoretical models and experiments that study visual processing in the context of normal motor behavior. In his talk, Michele argued that, as with other senses, vision relies heavily on sensorimotor strategies to extract and represent spatial information in the temporal domain.

We congratulate Yiqun Xiao!! She successfully defended her Master thesis titled "Perceived Contrast in Variegated Checkerboards". In her thesis she studied the contrast-contrast effect (Chubb, Sperling & Solomon, 1990) in variegated checkerboards (left image) and compared it to the original effect (right image).

On 12 December 2019, Professor William H. Warren (Brown University) kicked off the SCIoI Distinguished Lecture Series.

William Warren earned his undergraduate degree at Hampshire College (1976), his Ph.D. in Experimental Psychology from the University of Connecticut (1982), did post-doctoral work at the University of Edinburgh, and has been a professor at Brown ever since.

His research focuses on the visual control of action – in particular, human locomotion and navigation. 
On the one hand, he wants to understand how motor behavior such as gait and other rhythmic movements are dynamically organized. On the other, he seeks to explain how such behavior is adaptively regulated by visual information in complex environments.
Using virtual reality techniques, William H. Warren's research team investigates problems such as the visual control of steering, obstacle avoidance, pedestrian interactions, and collective crowd behavior.
