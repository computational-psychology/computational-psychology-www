      We study visual perception in humans, both experimentally and 
      through computational modeling. We focus on the question how
      meaningful perceptual categories arise from a given sensory 
      stimulation. In vision the sensory stimulation is the information 
      available in the light signal incident at the eye. 
      We tackle this problem with psychophysical experiments 
      and measure for example how surface appearance is related to 
      physical surface properties under varying viewing conditions. 
      We formulate computational models to account for the 
      perceptual judgments observers make. 
      In addition, we revise and develop experimental techniques 
      that we can use to reliably assess observers' perceptions.

Some new news
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

here some text about the news ..... 



New publication in Journal of Vision
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Marianne's and Guillermo's paper entitled "Towards reliable measurements of perceptual scales in multiple contexts" has published in the Journal of Vision. You can find it following this `link <https://doi.org/10.1167/jov.20.4.19>`_.


New group member: Maximilian Pohlmann
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On March 2020 Maximilian Pohlmann joined us in our group. Maximilian is a Bachelor student and will support us as a research assistant (HiWi).



On 12 December 2019, Professor William H. Warren (Brown University) kicked off the SCIoI Distinguished Lecture Series.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

William Warren earned his undergraduate degree at Hampshire College (1976), his Ph.D. in Experimental Psychology from the University of Connecticut (1982), did post-doctoral work at the University of Edinburgh, and has been a professor at Brown ever since.

His research focuses on the visual control of action – in particular, human locomotion and navigation. 
On the one hand, he wants to understand how motor behavior such as gait and other rhythmic movements are dynamically organized. On the other, he seeks to explain how such behavior is adaptively regulated by visual information in complex environments.
Using virtual reality techniques, William H. Warren's research team investigates problems such as the visual control of steering, obstacle avoidance, pedestrian interactions, and collective crowd behavior.




New group members: Joris Vincent, Lynn Schmittwilken, Bernhard Lang and Bianca del Mestre
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On November Joris joined us in our group. Joris joined us as a Post-doc. He is from the University of Pennsylvania, Dept. of Neurology. His contact details can be found in `People <people.html>`_. 

On October three new members joined us in our group. Lynn joined us as a Ph.D. student, and she is part of the 
`Science of Intelligence <https://www.scienceofintelligence.de>`_'s Doctoral Programm. Bernhard is co-supervised as a Ph.D. student in our lab. And Bianca is our new secretary. Their contact details can be found in `People <people.html>`_. 



ECVP19: we organized a Symposium and contributed with a talk
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Marianne Maertens co-organized the Symposium `Maximum Likelihood Difference Scaling (MLDS): Applications and challenges <https://www.conftool.pro/ecvp2019/index.php?page=browseSessions&form_session=15>`_ for the European Conference on Visual Perception (ECVP) held last August in Leuven, Belgium.
One of the five talks was given by Guillermo Aguilar with the title "Lightness scales measured with MLDS and MLCM in multiple contexts". The abstracts can be found `here <https://www.conftool.pro/ecvp2019/index.php?page=browseSessions&form_session=15>`_.
