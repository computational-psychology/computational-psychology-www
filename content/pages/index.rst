      We study visual perception in humans, both experimentally and 
      through computational modeling. We focus on the question how
      meaningful perceptual categories arise from a given sensory 
      stimulation. In vision the sensory stimulation is the information 
      available in the light signal incident at the eye. 
      We tackle this problem with psychophysical experiments 
      and measure for example how surface appearance is related to 
      physical surface properties under varying viewing conditions. 
      We formulate computational models to account for the 
      perceptual judgments observers make. 
      In addition, we revise and develop experimental techniques 
      that we can use to reliably assess observers' perceptions.

Yiqun Xiao sucessfully defended Master thesis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   :alt: Perceived contrast in Chubb et al. (1989) compared to variegated checkerboards.

On 2nd December 2020 Yiqun Xiao sucessfully defended her Master thesis titled "Perceived Contrast in Variegated Checkerboards". 
In her work Yiqun studied perceived contrast in variegated checkerboards (left panel) and compared surround induction effects against classical findings such as the contrast-contrast phenomenon (right panel). 
You can find the Abstract on our `Theses page <https://www.psyco.tu-berlin.de/theses.html#yiqun-xiao-perceived-contrast-in-variegated-checkerboards>`_ and the `full PDF here <files/theses/MasterThesis_YiqunXiao_2020.pdf>`_.
We congratulate Yiqun for defending her work and wish her all the best.

William Warren earned his undergraduate degree at Hampshire College (1976), his Ph.D. in Experimental Psychology from the University of Connecticut (1982), did post-doctoral work at the University of Edinburgh, and has been a professor at Brown ever since.

His research focuses on the visual control of action – in particular, human locomotion and navigation. 
On the one hand, he wants to understand how motor behavior such as gait and other rhythmic movements are dynamically organized. On the other, he seeks to explain how such behavior is adaptively regulated by visual information in complex environments.
Using virtual reality techniques, William H. Warren's research team investigates problems such as the visual control of steering, obstacle avoidance, pedestrian interactions, and collective crowd behavior.

Marianne Maertens co-organized the Symposium `Maximum Likelihood Difference Scaling (MLDS): Applications and challenges <https://www.conftool.pro/ecvp2019/index.php?page=browseSessions&form_session=15>`_ for the European Conference on Visual Perception (ECVP) held last August in Leuven, Belgium.
One of the five talks was given by Guillermo Aguilar with the title "Lightness scales measured with MLDS and MLCM in multiple contexts". The abstracts can be found `here <https://www.conftool.pro/ecvp2019/index.php?page=browseSessions&form_session=15>`_.
