      We study visual perception in humans, both experimentally and 
      through computational modeling. We focus on the question how
      meaningful perceptual categories arise from a given sensory 
      stimulation. In vision the sensory stimulation is the information 
      available in the light signal incident at the eye. 
      We tackle this problem with psychophysical experiments 
      and measure for example how surface appearance is related to 
      physical surface properties under varying viewing conditions. 
      We formulate computational models to account for the 
      perceptual judgments observers make. 
      In addition, we revise and develop experimental techniques 
      that we can use to reliably assess observers' perceptions.

New group members: Lynn Schmittwilken, Bernhard Lang and Bianca del Mestre
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On Oct three new members joined us in our group. Lynn joined us as a Ph.D. student, and she is part of the 
`Science of Intelligence <https://www.scienceofintelligence.de>`_'s Doctoral Programm. Bernhard is co-supervised as a Ph.D. student in our lab. And Bianca is our new secretary. Their contact details can be found in `People <people.html>`_. 



ECVP19: we organized a Symposium and contributed with a talk
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Marianne Maertens co-organized the Symposium `Maximum Likelihood Difference Scaling (MLDS): Applications and challenges <https://www.conftool.pro/ecvp2019/index.php?page=browseSessions&form_session=15>`_ for the European Conference on Visual Perception (ECVP) held last August in Leuven, Belgium.
One of the five talks was given by Guillermo Aguilar with the title "Lightness scales measured with MLDS and MLCM in multiple contexts". The abstracts can be found `here <https://www.conftool.pro/ecvp2019/index.php?page=browseSessions&form_session=15>`_.
